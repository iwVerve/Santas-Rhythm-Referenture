Be warned, just because it's possible doesn't mean it's fun or easy.

The Music folder needs to contain a <song>.ogg, and the Data folder needs a <song>.txt.
The first three lines of a data file indicate the bpm, the amount of subdivisions of each beat, and the song offset in frames to align the beat. Attacks must be ordered from earliest to latest.

Each further line is in the form:
<beat> <bit> <attack> <spawn>
Beat - The beat at which the attack spawns. First beat is 0.
Bit - The subdivision of a beat, from 0 to n-1 for n subdivisions.
Attack - Name of attack
Spawn - 1 or 0, whether to spawn the fruit as an obstacle. Sometimes necessary balance.

Attacks:
line_left, line_right - Rotating line
aimed_left, aimed_middle, aimed_right - Single fruit
rise_left, rise_middle, rise_right - Flat line
circle_left, circle_right - Rotating circle
bonus - Bonus ring
end - Spawns the warp

Every line after the first three that doesn't start with a number is ignored.
This means you can leave empty lines or comments for clarity.
